                                Growing up in Busan, Korea, within diverse communities and neighborhoods that were destinations for immigrant families, <strong>shaped my earliest sense of belonging and resilience</strong>. These experiences became the roots of my interest in migration, inequality, and the policies that shape people’s lives.

                                Books opened new horizons, but it was the stories of people’s lives that truly shaped my path.

                            My life is closely connected with my academic pathway. Growing up amongst more than twenty immigrant families, I witnessed how exclusion shaped their opportunities—in school, in health, and in everyday life. <strong>Over time, as some families moved on, their places were filled by new, yet not truly new, immigrant families facing the similar layers of exclusion. At the same time, I also saw the resilience they carried in building community and pursuing new beginnings.</strong> These experiences continue to guide the questions I ask as a researcher and the communities I strive to serve. They ground my academic focus on immigration, multidimensional poverty, and social policy, with a commitment to advancing equity for immigrants, refugees, and racialized populations.
